/**
 * RouteDefinition
 *
 * Represents a single route instance during its definition phase.
 * 
 * This class exists primarily to support "fluent" route APIs,
 * such as assigning names to routes immediately after declaring them.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *   Route::get('admin.home', fn() => '...')->name('admin.home');
 *
 * Internally:
 *   - The route is created with a normalized URI (e.g. "/admin/home")
 *   - A RouteDefinition object is returned
 *   - Calling ->name('admin.home') will register that name with the URI

     * organization, e.g. "admin.dashboard" or "users.show".

     * Example:
     *   Route::get('users.show', fn($id) => ...)->name('users.show');
     *
     * Later you can generate its URL:
     *   Route::url('users.show', ['id' => 42]); // â†’ "/users/42"

     * @param string $name The symbolic name of the route
